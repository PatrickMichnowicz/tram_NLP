Tram NLP project
This project is a simple NLP training using a raw text about tramways.
You will find basic techniques, such as tokenization, lemmatization, etc. 

In this repo, you can find: 
  - The raw text used for the project. This comes from an English Wikipedia article about tramways: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram
    28 out of 42 pages have been used, the missing pages contain references of the article, deemed unnecessary for this project.
  - Code ran during the project.

If you wish to run this internally, you will need: 
  - Python: most up-to-date version
  - nltk: both "NLTK" and "NLTK Data" (More info: https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#)
Depending on the libraries you have installed on your computer, additional setup may be required.
