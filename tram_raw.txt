Tram
A tram  (also known as a streetcar  or trolley  in the United
States ) is a type of urban rail transit  consistin g of either
individual railcars  or self-p ropelled multiple unit trains  that
run on tramway tracks  on urban  public streets; some include
segments on segregated right-of-way .[1][2][3] The tramlines or
tram networks operated as public transport  are called
tramways or simply trams/streetcars. Because of their close
similarities, trams are commonly included in the wider term
light rail,[4] which also includes systems separated from other
traffic.
Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than main line
and rapid transit  trains. Most trams use electrical power,
usually fed by a pantograph  sliding on an overhead line; older
systems may use a trolley pole  or a bow collector . In som e
cases, a contact shoe on a third rail is used. If necess ary, they
may have dual power systems—electricity in city streets and
diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also
carry freight . Some trams, known as tram-trains , may have
segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to
interurban  systems.  The differences between these modes of
rail transport are often indistinct, and systems may combine
multiple features.
One of the advanta ges over earlier forms of transit was the low
rolling resistance  of metal wheels on steel  rails, allowing the
trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Another factor
which contributed to the rise of trams was the high total cost of
ownership  of horse s. Electric trams largely replaced animal
power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements
in other vehicles such as buses  led to decline of trams in early
to mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence
since the 1980s.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram 1/42A horse-drawn tram operated by
Swansea and Mumbles Railway,
1870. Established in 1804, the
railway service was the world's first.The history of passenger trams, streetcars and trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth
century. It can be divided into several distinct periods defined by the principal means of power
used. Precursors to the tramway included the wooden or stone wagonways  that were used in
central Europe to transport mine carts  with unflanged wheels since the 1500s, and the paved
limestone trackways designed by the Romans for heavy horse and ox-drawn transportation. By the
1700s, paved plateways  with cast iron  rails were introduced in England for transporting coal, stone
or iron ore from the mines to the urban factories and docks.
The world 's first passenger train or tram was the Swansea and
Mumbles Railway , in Wales , UK. The British Parliament passed
the Mumbles Railway Act in 1804, and horse-drawn service
started in 1807.[5] The service closed  in 1827, but was restarted
in 1860, again using horses.[6] It was worked by steam from
1877, and then, from 1929, by very large (106-seat) electric
tramcars, until closure in 1960.[7] The Swansea and Mumbles
Railway was something of a one-o ff however, and no street
tramway appeared in Britain until 1860 when one was built in
Birkenhead  by the American George Francis Train .[8]
Street railways developed in America  before Europe, due to the
poor paving  of the streets in American cities which made them
unsuitable for horsebuses , which were then common on the well-paved streets of European cities.
Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride. There are records of a street
railway running in Baltimore  as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America,
was the New York and Harlem Railroad  developed by the Irish coach builder John Stephenson , in
New York City which began service in the year 1832.[9][10] The New York and Harlem Railroad's
Fourth Avenue Line  ran along the Bowery  and Fourth Avenue  in New York City. It was followed in
1835 by the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad  in New Orleans, Louisiana ,[11] which still
operates as the St. Charles Streetcar Line . Other American cities did not follow until the 1850s,
after which the "animal railway" became an increasingly common feature in the larger towns.[11]
The first permane nt tram line in continental Europe was opened in Paris in 1855 by Alphonse
Loubat  who had previously worked on American streetcar lines.[12] The tram was developed in
numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, Budapest ,
Birmingham , Saint Petersburg , Lisbon , London , Manchester , Paris , Kyiv ).
The first tram in South America opened in 1858 in Santiago, Chile . The first trams in Australia
opened in 1860 in Sydney . Africa's first tram service started in Alexandria  on 8 January 1863. The
first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in Batavia (Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia) .
Limitations of horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on
a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced
prodigious amoun ts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then
disposing. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for
four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar. In 1905 the
British newspape r Newcastle Daily Chronicle  reported that, "A large number of London's
discarded horse tramcars have been sent to Lincolnshire  where they are used as sleeping room s for
potato pickers ".[13]Horse-drawn13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

early 20th century. New York City had a regular horsecar
service on the Bleecker Street Line  until its closure in 1917.[14]
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , had its Sarah Street line drawn by
horses until 1923. The last regular mule-drawn cars in the US
ran in Sulphur Rock, Arkansas , until 1926 and were
commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp  issued in 1983.[15] The
last mule tram service in Mexico City ended in 1932, and a
mule tram in Celaya, Mexico , survived until 1954.[16] The last
horse-drawn tram  to be withdrawn from public service in the
UK took passengers from Fintona  railway station to Fintona
Junction one mile away on the main Omagh to Enniskillen
railway in Northern Ireland. The tram made its last journey on
30 September 1957 when the Omagh to Enniskillen line closed.
The "van" is preserved at the Ulster Transport Museum .
Horse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built Douglas Bay
Horse Tramway  on the Isle of Man , and at the 1894-built horse
tram  at Victor Harbor  in South Australia . New horse-drawn
systems have been established at the Hokkaidō  Museum in
Japan and also in Disneyland . A horse -tram route in Polish
gmina Mrozy , first built in 1902, was reopened in 2012.
The first mechanical trams were powered by steam .[17]
Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and
most common had a small steam locomotive  (called a tram
engine  in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages,
similar to a sma ll train. Systems with such steam trams
included Christchurch , New  Zealand; Sydney, Australia; other
city systems in New South Wales ; Munich , Germany (from
August 1883 on),[18] British India (from 1885) and the Dublin
& Blessington Steam Tramway (from 1888) in Ireland. Steam
tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines
around Milan  and Padua ; the last Gamba de Legn  ("Peg-Le g")
tramway ran on the Milan- Magenta -Castano Primo route in
late 1957.[19]
The other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a tram
engine  (UK) or steam dummy  (US). The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris.
French-designed steam trams also operated in Rockhampton , in the Australian state of
Queensland  between 1909 and 1939. Stockholm , Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of
Södermalm  between 1887 and 1901.
Tram engines usually had modifica tions to make them suitable for street running in residential
areas. The wheels , and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety
reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines fromSteam13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

to 1940, Melbourne operated one of
the largest cable car networks in the
world.emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used coke  rather than coal as fuel to avoid
emitting smoke; condensers  or superheating  were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major
drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually
underpowered. Steam trams faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric
trams.
Another motive system for trams was the cable car, which was
pulled along a fixed track  by a moving steel cable, the cable
usually running in a slot below the street level. The power to
move the cable was normally provided at a "powerhouse" site a
distance away from the actual vehicle. The London and
Blackwall Railway , which opened for passengers in east
London, England, in 1840 used such a system.[20]
The first practical cable car line was tested in San Fran cisco , in
1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an
effective and reliable cable grip mec hanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage.
The second city to operate cable trams was Dunedin , from 1881 to 1957.[21]
The most extensive cable system in the US was built in Chicago  in stages  between 1859 and 1892.
New York  City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909.[22] Los Angeles
also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railr oad, which operated from
1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.
From 1885 to 1940, the city of Melbourne , Victoria, Australia
operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its
peak running 592 trams on 75 kilometres (47 mi) of track.
There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney , New South
Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900, and
the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.
In Dresden , German y, in 1901 an elevated suspended  cable car
following the Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system
started operating. Cable cars operated on Highgate Hill in
North London and Kennington  to Brixton  Hill in South
London.  They also worked around "Upper Douglas" in the Isle
of Man from  1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73  is the sole survivor
of the fleet).
In Italy, in Trieste , the Trieste–Opicina tramway  was opened in 1902, with the steep est section of
the route being negotiated with the help of a funicular  and its cables.
Cable cars suffered from high infrastructure  costs, since an expensive system of cables , pulleys ,
stationary engines  and lengthy unde rground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided.
They also required physical strength  and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions
and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected ("dropped") at designated locations to allow
the cars to coast by inertia, for exam ple when crossing another cable line. The cable then had to be
"picked up" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage toCable-hauled13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to
overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) had to be replaced on a regular
schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-
maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.
Cable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since
their nondriven wheels did not lose traction  as they climbed or
descended a steep hill. The moving cable pulled the car up the
hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-
drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and track brakes ,
but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a
constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains
the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.
The San Francisco cable cars, though significantly reduced in
number, continue to provide regular  transportation service, in
addition to being a well-known tourist attraction . A single  cable
line also survives in Wellington  (rebuilt in 1979 as a funicular  but still called the "Wellington Cable
Car"). Another system, with two separate cable lines and a shared power station in the middle,
operates from the Welsh town of Llandudno  up to the top of the Great Orme  hill in North Wales ,
UK.
Hastings  and some other tramways, for example Stockholms
Spårvägar  in Sweden and some lines in Karachi , used petrol
trams. Galveston Island Trolley  in Texas operated diesel trams
due to the city's hurricane-prone location, which would have
resulted in frequent damage to an electrical supply system.
Although Portland, Victoria  promotes its tourist tram[23] as
being a cable car it actually operates using a diesel motor. The
tram, which runs on a circular route around the town of
Portland, uses dummies and salons formerly used on the
Melbourne cable tramway system  and since restored.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world
employed trams powered by gas, naphtha  gas or coal gas in particular. Gas trams are known to
have operated between Alphington  and Clifton Hill in the northern suburbs of Melbourne ,
Australia (1886–1888); in Berlin and Dresden , Germany; in Estonia  (1921–1951); between Jelenia
Góra , Cieplice , and Sobieszów  in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at Lytham St Annes , Trafford
Park , Manchester (1897–1908) and Neath , Wales (1896–1920).Liquid fossil fuel

Early electric trams operated by the
company lacked overhead wires,
drawing current from the rails.Comparatively little has been published about gas trams. However, research on the subject was
carried out for an article in the Octo ber 2011 edition of "The Times", the historical journal of the
Australian Associ ation of Timetable Collectors, later renamed the Australian Timetable
Association.[24][25][26][27]
The world 's first electric tram line operated in Sestroretsk  near
Saint Petersburg  invented and tested by inventor  Fyodor
Pirotsky  in 1875.[28][29] Later, using a similar technolog y,
Pirotsky put into service the first public electric tramway in St.
Petersburg, which  operated only during September 1880.[30]
The second demonstration tramway was presented by Siemens
& Halske at the 1879 Berlin Industrial Exposition. The first
public electric tramway used for permanent service was the
Gross-Lichterfelde tramway  in Lichterfelde  near Berlin in
Germany, which opened in 1881. It was built by Werner von
Siemens  who contacted Pirotsky. This was the world's first
commercially successful electric tram. It drew current from the
rails at first, with overhead wire  being installed in 1883.[31]
In Britain, Volk's Electric Railway  was open ed in 1883 in Brighton. This two kilometer line along
the seafro nt, re-gauged  to 2 ft 81⁄2 in (825 mm) in 1884, remains  in service as the oldest operating
electric tramway in the world. Also in 1883, Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram  was opened near
Vienna  in Austria. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity
served by an overhead line with pantograph  current collectors . The Blackpool Tramw ay was
opened in Blackpool, UK on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool
Promenade. This system is still in operation in modernised form.[32]
The earli est tram system in Canada was built by John Joseph Wright , brother  of the famous
mining entrepreneur Whitaker Wright , in Toronto  in 1883, introducing electric trams in 1892. In
the US, multiple experimental electric trams  were exhibited at the 1884 World Cotton Centennial
World's Fair in New Orleans, Louisiana , but they were not deemed good enough to replace the
Lamm  fireless engines then propelling the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar  in that city. The first
commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in Cleveland,
Ohio , and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company.[33] The
first city-wide electric streetcar system was implemented in 1886  in Montgomery, Alabama , by the
Capital City Street Railway  Company, and ran for 50 years.[34]
In 1888, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway  bega n to operate trams in Richmond, Virgini a,
that Frank J. Sprague  had built. Sprague later developed multiple unit control, first demonstrated
in Chicag o in 1897, allowing mult iple cars to be coupled together and operated by a single
motorman. This gave rise to the modern subway  train. Following the improvement of an overhead
"trolley" system on streetcars for collecting electricity from overhead wires  by Sprague, elect ric
tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.[35]
Earlier electric trains proved difficult or unreliable and experienced limited success until the
second half of the 1880s, when new  types of current collectors were developed.[30] Siemens ' line,
for example, provided power throug h a live rail and a return rail, like a model train, limiting the
voltage  that could be used, and delivering electric shocks  to people and animals crossing theElectric13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

collector . One of the first systems to use it was in Thorold, Ontario , opened in 1887, and it was
considered quite successful. While this line proved quite versatile as one of the earliest fully
functional electric streetcar installa tions, it required horse-drawn support while climbing the
Niagara Escarpment  and for two months of the winter when hydroelectricity  was not available. It
continued in service in its original form into the 1950s.
Sidney Howe Short designed  and produced the first electric motor  that operated a streetcar
without gears. The motor had its armature  direct-connected to the streetcar 's axle for the driving
force.[37][38][39][40][41] Short pioneered  "use of a conduit system of concealed feed" ther eby
eliminating the necessity of overhead wire  and a trolley pole for street cars and railways.[42][37][38]
While at the University of Denver he conducted experiments which established that multiple unit
powered cars were a better way to operate trains and trolleys.[37][38]
Electric tramways spread to many European cities in the 1890s,
such as:
Prague, Bohemia (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), in
1891;
Kyiv, Ukraine , in 1892;
Dresden, Germany; L yon, France; and Milan and Genoa,
Italy, Douglas, Isle of Man  in 1893;
Rome, Italy: Plauen, Germany; Bucharest, Romania;[43]
Lviv, Ukraine ; Belgrade, Serbia in 1894;
Bristol, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany in 1895;
Bilbao, Spain, in 1896;
Copenhagen, Denmark; and V ienna, Austria, in 1897;
Florence and Turin, Italy , in 1898;
Helsinki, Finland; and Madrid and Barcelona, Spain, in 1899.[30]
Sarajevo  built a citywide system of electric trams in 1895.[44] Budapest  established its tramway
system  in 1887, and its ring line has grown to be the busiest tram line in Europe, with a tram
running once per minute at rush hour. Bucharest  and Belgrade[45] ran a regular service from
1894.[46][47] Ljubljana  introduced its tram system  in 1901 – it closed in 1958.[48] Oslo  had the first
tramway in Scandinavia , starting operation on 2 March 1894.[49]
The first electric tramway in Australia was a Sprague system demonstrated at the 1888 Melbourne
Centennial Exhibition  in Melbourne ; afterwards, this was installed as a commercial venture
operating between the outer Melbourne suburb of Box Hill and the then tourist-oriented country
town Doncaster  from  1889 to 1896.[50] Elec tric systems were also built in Adelaide , Ballarat ,
Bendigo , Brisbane , Fremantle , Geelong , Hobart , Kalgoorlie , Launceston , Leonora , Newcastle ,
Perth , and Sydney .
By the 1970s, the only full tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system.
However, there were also a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the Glenelg tram line, connecting
Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg , and tourist trams in the Victorian Goldfields  cities of
Bendigo and Ballarat. In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as the largest
urban tram network in the world, has been considerably modernise d and expanded.[51] The
Adelaide line has been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and work is progressing on further
extensions.[52] Sydney  re-introduced trams (or light rail) on 31 August 1997. A completely new13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

Melbourne remained the only city to
operate a tram network in Australia
through the 1970s.

Queensland , on 20 July 2014. The Newcastle Light Rail opened
in Februa ry 2019, while the Canberra light rail opened on 20
April 2019.[53] This is the first time that there have been trams
in Canberra, even though Walter Burley Griffin 's 1914–1 920
plans for the capital then in the planning stage did propose a
Canberra tram system.[54]
In Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system,
starting operation in 1895.[55] By 1932, the network had grown
to 82 railway com panies in 65 cities, with a total network
length of 1,479 km (919 mi).[56] By the 1960s the tram had
generally died out in Japan.[57][58]
Two rare but significant alternatives were conduit current
collection , which was wide ly used in Lond on, Washington,
D.C., and New York City, and the surface contact collection
method, used in Wolverhampton  (the Lorain system ), Torquay
and Hastings  in the UK (the Dolter stud system), and in
Bordeaux , France (the ground-level power supply  system).
The convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its
rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were
solved. Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including
cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
There was one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead
line on the early electrified systems.  Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current
return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track
that has been heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the
rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads
(such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC. In British
terminology, such a tram was said to be 'grounded'—not to be confused with the US English use of
the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram and completing the
earth retu rn circui t with their body could receive a serious electric shock. If "grounded", the driver
was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground)
and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram
could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the
tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.  With improved
technology, this ceased to be an problem.
In the 2000s, several companies introduced catenary-free designs: Alstom's Citadis line uses a
third rail, Bombardier's PRIMOVE LRV is charged by contactless inducti on plates embedded in the
trackway and CAF URBOS tram uses ultracaps technology[59][60]
As early as 1834, Thomas Davenpor t, a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered
electric motor which he later patented. The following year he used it to operate a small model
electric car on a short section of track four feet in diameter.[61][62]Battery13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

for about 14 year s as The Hague  accutram  of HTM  in the
Netherlands. The first trams in Bendigo, Australia, in 1892,
were battery-powe red, but within as little as three months they
were replaced with  horse-drawn trams. In New York  City some
minor lines also used storage batteries. Then, more recently
during the 1950s, a longer battery-operated tramway line ran
from Milan  to Bergamo . In Chin a there is a Nanjing battery

The Convict Tramway[69] was hauled by human power in the
form of convicts from the Port Arthur  convict settlement.[70]
and was created to replace the hazardous sea voyage from
Hobart  to Port Arthur, Tasmania .[71][69] Charles O'Hara Booth
oversaw the construction of the tramway.[72]
It opened  in 1836 and ran for 8 km (5.0 mi) from Oakwood to
Taranna .[73] By most definitions, the tramway was the first
passenger-carrying railway/tramway in Australia.[71] An
unconfirmed report says that it continued to Eaglehawk Neck
and, if this was so, the length of the tramway would have been
more than doubled. The tramway carried passengers and
freight, and ran on wooden rails. The gauge is unknown. The
date of closure is unknown, but it was certainly prior to
1877.[74]Compressed air

The Trieste–Opicina tramway  in Trieste  operates  a hybrid funicular tramway system. Conventional
electric trams are operated in street running  and on reserved track  for most of their route.
However, on one steep segment of track, they are assisted by cable tractors, which push the trams
uphill and act as brakes for the down hill run. For safety, the cable tractors are always deployed on
the downhill side of the tram vehicle.
Similar systems were used elsewhere in the past, notably on the Queen Anne Coun terbalance  in
Seattle and the Darling Street  wharf line in Sydney.
In the mid-20th century many tram systems were disbanded, replace d by buses, trolleybuses ,
automobiles or rapid transit . The General Motors streetcar conspiracy  was a case study of the
decline of trams in the United States. In the 21st century, trams have been re-introduced in cities
where they had been closed down for decades (such as Tramlink  in London), or kept in heritage
use (such  as Spårväg City in Stockholm). Most trams made since the 1990s (such as the
Bombardier Flexit y series and Alstom Citadis ) are articulated low-floor trams  with features such  as
regenerative braking .
Trams have been used for two main purposes: for carrying
passengers and for carrying cargo. There are several types of
passenger tram:

Lisbon.
Several trams in Toronto on a
dedicated right of way lane. The
tram in the left foreground is about
to enter a portion of the tram
network that operates in mixed
traffic.
Overhead lines are used to provide
power for most electric trams.
Overhead wires are used for both
trams and light rail systems.There are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway
built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating
in mixed  traffic, and the later type which is most often
associated with the tram system having its own right of way.
Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called
light rail but this does not always hold true. Though these two
systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the
same.
Trams were traditionally operated with separate levers for
applying power and brakes. More modern vehicles use a
locomotive -style controller which incorporate a dead man's
switch . The success of the PCC stree tcar had also seen trams
use automobile-style foot controls  allowing hands-free
operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare
collection.
Electric trams use various devices to collect power from
overhead lines . The most common device is the pantograph ,
while som e older systems use trolley poles or bow collectors .
Ground-level pow er supply  has become a more recent
innovation. Anoth er technology uses supercapacitors ; when an
insulator  at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a
short distance alon g the line, the tram can use energy stored in
a large capacitor  to drive the tram past the gap in the power
feed.[77] The old tram systems in London, Manhattan  (New
York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on
third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the
road, from which they drew power  through a plough . It was
called conduit current collection . Washington's was the last of
these to close, in 1962. No commercial tramway uses this
system anymore. More recently, an equivalent to these systems
has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a
third rail on city streets, known as surface current collection or
ground-level power supply ; the main example  of this is the new
tramway in Bordeaux .
A ground -level power supply system, also called surface current collecti on or alimentation par le
sol (APS), is an updated version of the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed
between the running rails, divided  electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three-
metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are
antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.Controls

The fragmented tram routes of Paris
are slowly being joined up.Older systems required mechanical switching systems which
were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time
no more than two consecutive segme nts under the tram should
be live. Wireless and solid state switching eliminate mechanical
problems.
Alstom  develop ed the system primarily to avoid intrusive
power supply cables in the sensitive  area of the old city of old
Bordeaux .[78]
Route patterns vary greatly among the world's tram systems,
leading to different network topologies .
Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated
radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with
residential suburbs and traf fic hubs such as railway stations
and hospitals, usually following main roads. Some of these,
such as those in Hong Kong , Blackpool  and Bergen , still
essentially comprise a single route. Some suburbs may be
served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads.
Some modern systems have started by reusing existing
radial railway tracks, as in Nottingham  and Birmingham ,
sometimes joining them together  by a section of street track
through the city centre, as in Manchester . Later
developments often include tangential routes linking
adjacent suburbs directly , or multiple routes through the
town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester's
Second City Crossing ).
Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which
already have well-developed metro and suburban railway
systems, such as London  and Paris , have started by
building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations. In Paris these have then
been linked by ring lines .
A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small
settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by BOGESTRA  or the Silesian
Interurbans .
A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a downtown circulator ,
as in Portland  or El Paso .
Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in
Stockholm .
The resu lting route patterns are very different. Some have a rational structure, covering their
catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral
to their layout – such is the case in Amsterdam . Bordeaux  and Montpellier  have built
comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interco nnections, within the last
two decades. Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with Berlin  being the prime example, as
trams survived the city's political division only in the Eastern part. Other systems have ended up
with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have
ceased operation (as with the tramways vicinau x/buurtspoorwegen  in Brussels ) or where isolated
outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin). In Rome , the remn ant of the
system comprises three isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linkedRoutes13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

Cross section of a
grooved tram railby a ring route. Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would
not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than to
continue operating an existing one.
In some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though
without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case
in Leipzigerstraße  in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.
Tram systems operate across national borders in Basel  (from Switzerland into France and
Germany), Geneva  (from Switzerland into France) and Strasbourg  (from France into Germany). A
planned line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands)  was cancelled in June 2022.
Where tracks diverge, the driver chooses the route, usually
either by flicking a switch on the dashboard or by use of the
power pedal – generally if power is applied the tram goes
straight on, whereas if no power is applied the tram turns.
Some systems use automatic point-setting systems, where the
route for each jour ney is downloaded from a central computer,
and an onboard computer actuates each point as it comes to it
via an induction loop . Such is the case at Manchester
Metrolink .[79] If the powered system breaks down, most points
may be operated manually, by inserting a metal lever ('point
iron') into the point machine .
Tramway track can have different rail
profiles  to accommodate the various
operating environments of the vehicle.
They may be emb edded into concrete
for street-running operation, or use
standard ballasted  track with railroad
ties on high-speed sections. A more
ecological solution is to embed tracks
into grass turf, an approach known as
green track .
Tramway tracks use a grooved rail with
a groove  designed for tramway or railway track in pavement  or grassed
surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). The rail has the railhead on one
side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard
carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by Alphonse
Loubat , a French invento r who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped
develop tram lines in New York City and Paris. The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to
be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get
their wheels caught in the groove. The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularlyCross-border trams

done by a "scrubbe r" tram. Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bum py ride for the passengers,
damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.
In narrow  situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid
switches , have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in Amsterdam  on three short stretches

known as interlaced or gauntlet track . There is a UK example of interlaced track on the Tramlink ,
just west of Mitch am Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an
obstruction. (See photo in Tramlink  entry).
Historically, the track gauge  has had considerable variations, with narrow gauge  common in many
early systems. However, most light rail systems are now standard gauge . An impo rtant advantage
of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than
custom-built mach inery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and
relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.
Another factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there
is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge
layout. Standard gauge also enables – at least in theory – a larger choice of manufacturers and thus
lower procurement costs for new vehicles. However, other factors such as electrification or loading
gauge  for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.Track gauge
Tram stop13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram 14/42Tram stops may be similar to bus stops  in design  and use, particularly in street-running sections,
where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors. Some stops
may have railway platforms , particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are
boarded at standar d railway platform height , as oppos ed to using steps at the doorway or low-floor
trams .
Approximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year. As of February 2017, 4,478 new

Trams (and road public transport in general) can be much more ef ficient in terms of road usage
than cars – one vehicle replaces about 40 cars (which take up a far larger area of road
space).[81][82]
Vehicles run more efficiently  compared to similar vehicles that use rubber tyres, since the
rolling resistance  of steel on steel is lower than rubber on asphalt.[83]
There is a well studied ef fect that the installation of a tram service – even if service frequency ,
speed and price all remain constant – leads to higher ridership and mode shift away from cars
compared to buses.[84] Conversely , the abandonment of tram service leads to measurable
declines in ridership.
Being guided by rails means that even very long tram units can navigate tight, winding city
streets that are inaccessible to long buses.Manufacturing

Advantages13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram 15/42Produced in 1923 and 1924, the 900
Series tram is still used by the New
Orleans tram system. Trams
typically have longer service life
than internal combustion buses.
A V3A tram running down tracks

Boulevard in Bucharest, Romania
A Nantes tram in front of the Bouffay
stopTram vehicles are very durable, with some being in
continuous revenue service for more than fifty years. This is
especially true compared to internal combustion buses,
which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and
break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the
vibrations of the engine.
In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than
similar buses. This has been cited as a reason for the
replacement of one of Europe's busiest bus lines (with
three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by
Dresdner V erkehrsbetriebe .
Due to the above-mentioned capacity advantage, labor
costs (which form the biggest share of operating costs of
many public transit systems) per passenger can be
significantly lower compared to buses.
Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than
subways or other forms of heavy rail . In Berlin the
commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs
as much as ten kilometers of tramway .
ULR Ultra Light Rail developments with prefabricated track
and onboard power (no OHL  Over Head Line) in the UK are
aiming for £10 m per km[85] as opposed to convention tram
rail and OHL  at £20–£30 m per km.[86]
Tramways can take advantage of old heavy rail  alignments.
Some examples include the Manchester Metrolink  of which
the Bury Line  was part of the East Lancashire Railway , the
Altrincham Line  was part of the Manchester South Junction
and Altrincham Railway , and the Oldham and Rochdale
Line was the Oldham Loop Line . Other examples can be
found in Paris , London , Boston , Melbourne  and Sydney .
They hence sometimes take advantage of high speed track
while on train tracks.
As tram lines are permanent this allows local authorities to
redevelop and revitalise their towns and cities provided
suitable planning changes are made.[87] Melbourne will
allow higher buildings (5 to 6 story) along tram routes
leaving the existing suburbs behind unchanged whilst
doubling the cities density .[88]
The tram with its fixed route gives developers confidence to
invest as opposed to a changeable bus route.
Trams produce less air pollution than rubber tyred transport
which produce tyre, asphalt and brake based pollutants.
The use of regenerative electric motor braking in trams lowers mechanical brake use. Steel
wheel and rail particulates are produced but regular wheel alignment and flexible track
mounting can reduce emissions.
Tram networks can link to other operational heavy rail and rapid transit systems, allowing
vehicles to move directly from one to the other without passengers needing to alight. Trams
that are compatible with heavy rail systems are called tram-trains , while those that can use
subway tunnels are called pre-metro  or Stadtbahn .
Passengers can reach surface stations quicker than underground stations. Subjective safety at
surface stations is often seen to be higher .
Trams can be tourist attractions in ways buses usually are not.

tracks which has a psychological ef fect on perceived noise levels and the benefits of13/10/2024 15:55 Tram - Wikipedia

daily operations.
Installing rails for tram tracks and overhead lines for power
means a higher up-front cost than using buses which
require no modifications to streets to begin operations.
Tram tracks can be hazardous for cyclists, as bikes,
particularly those with narrow tyres, may get their wheels
caught in the track grooves.[89] It is possible to close the
grooves of the tracks on critical sections by rubber profiles
that are pressed down by the wheelflanges of the passing
tram but that cannot be lowered by the weight of a
cyclist.[90] If not well-maintained, however , these lose their
effectiveness over time.
When wet, tram tracks tend to become slippery and thus
dangerous for bicycles and motorcycles, especially in
traffic.[89][91] In some cases, even cars can be af fected.[92]
The opening of new tram and light rail systems has sometimes been accompanied by a
marked increase in car accidents, as a result of drivers' unfamiliarity with the physics and
geometry  of trams.[93] Though such increases may be temporary , long-term conflicts between
motorists and light rail operations can be alleviated by segregating their respective rights-of-
way and installing appropriate signage and warning systems.[94]
Rail transport can expose neighbouring populations to moderate levels of low-frequency noise.
However , transportation planners use noise mitigation  strategies to minimise these ef fects.[95]
Most of all, the potential for decreased private motor vehicle operations along the tram's
service line because of the service provision could result in lower ambient noise levels  than
without.
The overhead power lines and supporting poles utilized by trams (except for those using a third
rail) can be unsightly and contribute to visual pollution .[96]
Trams are in a period of growth, with about 800 tram systems
operating around the world, 10 or so new systems being opened
each year, and many being gradually extended.[98] Some of
these systems date from the late 19th  or early 20th centuries. In
the past 20 years their numbers have been augmented by
modern tramway  or light rail systems in cities that had
abandoned this form of transport. There have also been some
new tram systems in cities that never previously had them.
Tramways with tramcars  (British English ) or street railways
with streetcars  (North American English ) were common
throughout the industrialised world in the late 19th and early
20th centuries but they had disappe ared from most British, Canadian, French and US cities by the
mid-20th century.[99]
By contra st, trams in parts of continental Europ e continue d to be used by many cities, although
there were declines in some countries, including the Netherlands.[100]Disadvantages

Map of Melbourne's tram system in
2011. The tram system is the largest
the world.Since 1980 trams have returned to favour in many
places, partly because their tendency to dominate
the roadway, formerly seen as a disadvantage, is
considered to be a merit since it raises the visibility
of public transport (encouraging car users to change
their mode of travel), and enables streets to be
reconfigured to give more space to pedestrians,
making cites more pleasant places to live. New
systems have been built in the United States, United
Kingdom, Ireland , Italy, France, Australia and
many other countries.
In Milan, Italy, the old "Ventotto " trams are consid ered a "symbol" of the city. The same can be

third largest was Chicago, with over 850 km (530 mi) of

by 21 June 1958. Before its decline, the BVG  in Berlin operated
a very large netwo rk with 634 km (394 mi) of route. Before its
system was conve rted to trolleybus (and later bus) services in
the 1930s (last tramway closed 6 July 1952), the first-
generation London network had 555 km (345 mi) of route in
1931.[130] In 1958 trams in Rio de Jainero were employed on
(433 km; 269 mi) of track. The final line, the Santa Teresa
route  was close d in 1968.[131] During a period in the 1980s, the
world's largest tram system was in Leningrad  (St. Petersburg)
with 350 km (220 mi), USSR, and was included as such in the
Guinness World Records ; however Saint Petersburg's tram system has declined in size since the
fall of the Soviet Union. Vienna  in 1960 had 340 km (211 mi), before the expansion of bus services
and the opening of a subway (197 6). Substituting subway services for tram routes continues.
320 km (199 mi) was in Minneapolis–Saint Paul  in 1947: There streetcars ended 31 October 1953
in Minneapolis and 19 June 1954 in St. Paul.[132] The Sydney tram network , befo re it was closed on
25 February 1961, had 291 km (181 mi) of route, and was thus the largest in Australia. Since 1961,
the Melb ourne system (recognised as the world's largest) assumed Sydney's title as the largest
network in Australia.
Tramway systems were well established in the Asian region at the start of the 20th century but
started a steady decline during the mid to late 1930s. The 1960s marked the end of its
dominance in public transportation with most major systems closed and the equipment and
rails sold for scrap; however , some extensive original systems still remain in service in Japan.
In recent years there has been renewed interest in the tram with modern systems being built in
Japan and China.
Tram services in China  existed in several cities during the
20th century; however , by the end of the century , only the
systems in Dalian , Hong Kong , and Changchun  remained
extant. The 21st century has seen a resurgence in the
development of tram transport as China struggles with
urban traf fic congestion and pollution with at least 15
systems operating. Hong Kong has an exclusive fleet of
double-decker trams. As of 2019, Wuyishan , Baoshan ,
Jiaxing , and Haikou  have new tram systems under

In Batavia (Jakarta), the capital of the former Dutch colony
of the Netherlands East Indies, a horse tram service started
in 1869. A steam tram ran from 1881, and electrification
followed in 1897. All Jakarta trams were discontinued in the
1960s by an independent Indonesia due to pressure from
Sukarno , who saw tram network as "antiquated" and a "relic of [the] colonial era". The other
cities in Indonesia who used to have urban tram network were Surabaya  and Semarang .
The Semarang tram network was constructed between 1882 and 1883, essentially as an inner
suburb extension of the Samarang Joana Railway (SJS) network. The company already had
an extensive rural tram network to the east of Semarang. Due to financial dif ficulties that
hampered the SJS railway company , the Semarang tram network was closed in 1940 (despite
public protest in Semarang) and their rolling stock transferred to the Surabaya tram network.
Surabaya's tram network was built in 1886. Initially consisting of steam trams only , electric
trams were added in 1923. They served Surabaya commuters well into the independence era.
The electric tram bowed out from service in 1968, while its steam counterpart outlived the
electrics, becoming the world's last urban steam tram service before its closure in 1978.
In 2012, there was talk of reviving Surabaya's tram network as a part of Surabaya Mass Rapid
Transit project, which will see parts of the old electric tram right of way reactivated, and it will
be combined with the future monorail network. The project is aimed to alleviate Surabaya's
traffic congestion and provide cheap public transportation for Surabaya commuters. In 2014,
the project entered the tender phase.
The 13-kilometre-long Jerusalem Light Rail  system began operation in August 201 1 and is
being extended, with the full system expected to be in operation by 2023. A significant portion
of it will be underground. A light rail system for Beersheba  is also planned.
The first Japanese tram line was inaugurated in 1895 as the Kyoto Electric Railroad . The tram
reached its zenith in 1932 when 82 rail companies operated 1,479 kilometres of track in 65
cities. The tram declined in popularity through the remaining years of the 1930s and during the
1960s many of the remaining operational tramways were shut down or converted into
commuter railway lines.
A tram system is planned for construction in Gwadar , Pakistan, where construction started in
late 201 1.
Trams are also under construction in DHA City, Karachi .
The Northern and Central areas of the City of Colombo  had an electric Tram Car system

(Circular LR T), followed by the Danhai Light Rail  Transit in Northern Taiwan.
An extensive tram system  ran in Bangkok from 1888, until it was suspended in 1968. A smaller
single-route tram route tram in Lopburi  was also suspended in the early 1960s.
Other countries with discontinued tram systems include Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia ,
Pakistan , Philippines , and Vietnam .
Urban public tran sportation has been experiencing a sustained revival since the 1990s. Many
European cities are rehabilitating, upgrading, expanding and reconstructing their old tramway
lines and building new tramway lines.[135] In 2014 , the Aubagne tramway  in Southern France
became the first tram system in the world not to charge fares .[136]
In many European cities, tramway infrastructure was lost
during the mid-20th century, though not always on the same
scale as in other parts of the world such as North America.
Most of Central and Eastern Europe retained the majority of its
tramway systems and it is here that the largest and busiest
tram systems in the world are found. Germany and France have
the most tram systems, with over 50 and over 30 networks.
In the UK, most  of the old Victorian era tramways were
decommissioned from the 1950s–70s and replaced by buses.
The exceptions were Blackpool Tramway , opened in 1885 and
one of the few tramways to use double decker trams  in the 21st century, and Great Orme Tramway
which has operated at Llandudno  since 1902.[137]
Since the early 2000s, tramways have been restored in many cities to reduce commuters'
dependency on cars. These include Edinburgh Tramw ay, Manchester Metro link, and Nottingham
Tramway .
Many decommissioned trams are preserved at transport museum s and heritage railways . The first
of these was Seaton Tramway , which opened in 1971 but dates back to 1949. Other preserved
tramways include Crich Tramway  (ope ned 1963), East Anglia Transport Museum  (ope ned 1965),Taiwan

1980), and Wirral Tramway  (opened 1995). Additionally,
Beamish Museum  has reconstructed a turn of the century
tramway using original rails and preserved tramcars.[138]
In North America, these vehicles are called "streetcars" (or
"trolleys" in parts of the United States); the term tram  is more
likely to be unders tood as an aerial tramway  or a people-mover ,
though "tram" may be used colloquially in Canada. Streetcar
systems were developed in late 19th to early 20th centuries in a number of cities throughout North
America. However , most North American cities saw their streetcar lines removed in the mid-20th
century for a variety of financial, tech nological and social reasons. Exceptions included Boston ,[139]
Cleveland , Mexico City, New Orleans , Newark , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , San Francisco , and
Toronto .
Toronto  operates the largest streetcar system in the Americas
in terms of track length and ridership. Operated by the Toronto
Transit Commission , the syste m consists of both street-running
and grade-separa ted tramways. The streetcar system was
established in 1861, and used a variety of vehicles in its history,
including horse-d rawn streetcars, Peter Witt streetcars , the
PCC streetcar, and the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle  and its
articulated counterpart, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle .
Since 29 December 2019,[140] the system exclusively uses the
Flexity Outlook  made by Bombardier
Transportation .[141][142][143][144]
Streetcars once existed in the Canadian cities of Calgary ,
Edmonton , Halifax , Hamilton , Kingston , Kitchener , London , Montreal , Ottawa , Peterborough ,
Quebec City, Regina , Saskatoon , Windsor , Winnipeg, St. John's and Vancouver . However,
Canadian cities excluding Toronto, removed their streetcar systems in the mid-20th century. In the
late 1970s and early 1980s, light rail systems were introduced in Calgary and Edmonton; with
another light rail system established  in Ottawa in 2001. There has been something of a renaissance
for light railways in mid-sized cities with Waterloo, Ontario  the first to come on line and
construction underway in Mississauga, Ontario  and Hamilton, Ontario . In the late 20th century,
several Canadian locales restored portions of their defunct streetcar lines, operating them as a
heritage feature for tourists. Heritage streetcar lines in Canada includ e the High Level Bridge
Streetcar  in Edmonton, the Nelson Electric Tramway  in Nelson , and the Whitehorse Water front
Trolley  in Whitehorse .
Pittsburgh had kept most of its streetcar system serving the city and suburbs, making it the
longest-lasting large-network streetcar system in the United States.  However, most of the city's
streetcar lines had been abandoned by the early 1970s, and the handful of surviving streetcar lines
were converted to light rail in the 1980s. San Francisco's Muni Metro system is the largestNorth America

revived previously  closed streetcar lines such as the F Market &
Wharves  heritage streetcar line. In the late 20th century,
several cities installed modern light rail systems, some along
the same corridors as their old streetcars systems, the first of
these being the San Diego Trolley  in San Diego  in 1981.
In the 1980s, som e cities in the United States brought back
streetcar lines, including Memphis , Tampa , and Little Rock ;
However, these streetcar systems were designed as heritage
streetcar lines, and used vintage or replica-vintage vehicles.
The first "secon d-generation streetcar system" in North
America was opened in Portland  in 2001.[145] The system
utilizes modern vehicles that feature low-floor streetcars. These newer streetcar systems were built
in several American cities in the early 21st century including Atlanta , Charlotte , Cincinnati , Dallas ,
Detroit , Kansas City , Milwaukee , Oklahoma City , Seattle , Tucson , and Washington, D.C.
Historically , there have been trams in the following Australian cities and towns: Adelaide ,
Ballarat , Bendigo , Brisbane , Broken Hill , Derby , Fremantle , Gawler , Geelong , Hobart ,
Kalgoorlie , Launceston , Leonora , Maitland , Melbourne , Moonta –Wallaroo , Newcastle , Perth ,
Rockhampton , Sorrento , Sydney  and Victor Harbor . They ranged from extensive systems to
single lines. V irtually all known types of motive power have been utilised in Australia at some
stage.
The Sydney system, which closed in 1961, was the most extensive and the largest passenger
carrier of any Australian public transport system then or since, moving over 400 million
passengers per annum, at its peak. In 1997, Sydney reintroduced tram services on a modern
light rail network ; the 2010s saw a significant expansion of the network.
Melbourne and Adelaide were the only major cities in Australia to retain trams (although
Adelaide only retained a single line and dismantled the rest of its network). Other cities had
largely dismantled their tram networks by the 1970s.
Ballarat and Bendigo have retained some trams as heritage vehicles operating on limited
trackage. In 2008 and 2009, Bendigo trialled using its heritage trams for regular public
transport, but the service was too infrequent to be useful for that.
Portland, V ictoria , introduced a tourist tram line in 1996, which uses two replicas of a
Melbourne cable tram  grip car  or dummy , driven by a concealed diesel  motor , and two restored
trailer cars.
A completely new tram system opened on the Gold Coast  on 20 July 2014, with a major
extension completed in December 2017. That system is known as the G:link  and is the first
tram/light rail system in the state of Queensland since Brisbane closed its tram network in
1969.
The construction of light rail in Canberra  became the major issue of the 2016 ACT election ,
with the governing coalition supporting the project and the opposition against it. The
government was returned[146] and Stage 1 of the light rail launched in April 2019.[147]

PreMetro line E2 is a tram network
that has operated in Buenos Aires
since 1987.There are tentative plans for new tram systems in Hobart
and on the Sunshine Coast .
New Zealand's tram gauges were not standardised; the 15
systems used no less than five gauges, making swapping
of rolling stock from system to system impractical.[a]
Buenos Aires  once had one of the most extensive tramway
networks in the world with over 857 km (533 mi) of track,
but most of it was dismantled during the 1960s in favour of
bus transportation. A new line, the PreMetro line E2  system
feeding the Line E  of the Buenos Aires Underground  has
been operating since 1987 on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

In January 1864, well-known Anglo-Australian  musician  and composer  Isaac Nathan  was hit
and killed by a Sydney horse tram when his clothing was caught in the door , whilst he was
attempting to alight. Nathan is reputed to be one of the first tram fatalities in the Southern
Hemisphere (many sources claim that it was the first such accident).[155][156]
On the morning of 18 August 1901, four masked men, described as "urban bushrangers ", held
up an eastbound horse tram in Riversdale Road, Melbourne , just past Power Street. For their
trouble the men received £2 10/-  in fares from driver Thomas Taylor , and £21 19/- from eight
passengers. One passenger was injured. The bandits were never caught. Contemporary
newspapers hypothesised that the bandits were after a specific commuter who travelled
regularly on this particular tram and who was in the habit of carrying large amounts of
cash.[157][158]
In the Tottenham Outrage  in 1909, two armed robbers hijacked a tram and were chased by the

Model trams are popular in HO scale (1:87) and O scale (1:48 in the US and generally 1:43,5  and
1:45 in Europe and Asia). They are typically powered and will acce pt plastic figures inside.
Common manufac turers are Roco  and Lima , with many custom models being made as well. The
German firm Hödl[162] and the Austrian Halling[163] specialise in 1:87 scale.[164]
In the US, Bachmann Indus tries  is a mass supplier of HO streetcars and kits. Bowser
Manufacturing  has prod uced white metal models for over 50 years.[165] There are many boutique
vendors offering limited run epoxy and wood models. At the high end are highly detailed brass
models which are usually imported from Japan or Korea and can cost in excess of $500. Many of
these run on 16.5 mm (0.65 in) gauge track, which is correct for the representation of 4 ft 81⁄2 inChile

trams are also very popular among tram modellers because the
increased size allows for more detail and easier crafting of
overhead wiring. In the US these models are usually purchased
in epoxy or wood kits and some as brass models. The Saint

It is thought that the first example of a working model tramcar in the UK built by an amateur for
fun was in 1929, when Frank E. Wilson created a replica of London County Council Tramways E
class car 444 in 1:16 scale, which he demonstrated at an early Model Engineer Exhibition. Another
of his models was London E/1 1800, which was the only tramway exhibit in the Faraday Memorial
Exhibition of 1931. Together with likeminded friends, Frank Wilson went on to found the Tramway
& Light Railway Society[170] in 1938, establishing tramway modelling as a hobby.
The Engl ish terms tram  and tramway  are derived from  the
Scots  word tram ,[171] referring respectively to a type of truck
(goods wagon or freight railroad car) used in coal mine s and
the tracks  on which they ran. The word tram  probably  derived
from Middle Flemish  trame  ("beam, handle of a barrow, bar,
rung"). The identical word trame  with the meaning
"crossbeam" is also used in the French language . Etymologists
believe that the word tram  refers to the woo den beams the
railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad
pioneers switched  to the much more wear-resistant tracks
made of iron and, later, steel.[172] The word Tram-car  is
attested from 1873.[173]
Although the terms tram  and tramway  have been adopted by many languages, they are not used
universally in English; North Americans prefer streetcar , trolley , or trolleycar . The term streetcar
is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to horsecars .
The term s streetcar  and trolley  are often used interchangeably in the United States, with trolley
being the preferred term in the eastern US and streetcar  in the western US. Streetcar  is preferred
in English Canada , while tramway  is preferred in Quebec . In parts of the United States, intern ally
powered buses  made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as "trolleys". To avoid furtherEtymology and terminology

Maine
A trackless train is also called tram
in U.S. English.confusion with trolley buses , the American Public
Transportation Association  (APTA) refers to them as "trolley-
replica buses ". In the United States, the term  tram  has
sometimes been used for rubber-tir ed trackless trains , which
are unrelated to other kinds of trams.
A widely held belief holds the word trolley to derive from the
troller  (said to derive from the words traveler  and roller ), a
four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead
wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car
and collected electrical power from the overhead wires ;[174] this
portmanteau derivation  is, however, most likely folk
etymology . "Trolley" and variants refer to the verb troll ,
meaning "roll" and probably derived from Old Frenc h,[175] and cognate uses of the word were well
established for handcarts and horse drayage, as well as for nautical uses.[176]
The alternative North American term 'trolley' may strictly
speaking be considered incorrect, as the term can also be
applied to cable cars, or conduit cars that instead draw power
from an undergrou nd supply. Conventional diesel tourist buses
decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called trolleys
in the US (tourist trolley ). Furthering confusion, the term tram
has inste ad been applied to open-si ded, low-speed segmented
vehicles on rubbe r tires  generally  used to ferry tourists short
distances, for example on the Universal Studios backlot tour
and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major
destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g.
the Roosevelt Island Tramway .
The New South Wales  government in Australia has decided to use the term "light rail" for their
trams.
Although the use of the term trolley  for tram was not adopted in Euro pe, the term was later
associated with the trolleybus , a rubber-tired vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its
power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also
called trackless trolleys  (particul arly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply trolleys  (in the
UK, as well as the Pacific Northwest , including Seattle , and Vancouver ).
